# Fake-News-Detection
The fake news has been rapidly increasing in numbers. It is not a new problem but recently it has been on a great rise. 
According to Wikipedia, Fake news is false or misleading information presented as news. 
Detecting the fake news has been a challenging and a complex task. 
It is observed that humans have a tendency to believe the misleading information which makes the spreading of fake news even easier. 
Fake news is dangerous as it can deceive people easily and create a state of confusion among a community. This can further affect the society badly.
The spread of fake news creates rumors circulating around and the victims could be badly impacted. 
Fake news might be created by people or groups who are acting in their own interests or those of third parties. 
The creation of misinformation is usually motivated by personal, political, or economic agendas. 
Therefore it is very important to detect if the news is fake or not. 
Since a lot of time is spent by users on social media and people prefer online means of information it has become difficult to know about the authenticity of the news. 
People acquire most of the information by these means as it is free and can be accessed from anywhere irrespective of place and time. 
Since this data can be put out by anyone there is lack of accountability in it which makes it less trustable unlike the traditional methods of gaining information like newspaper or some trusted source. 
In this paper, we deal with such fake news detection issue. We have used the techniques of NLP and ML to build the model. We have also compared text vectorization methods and obtained the one which gives a better output.
